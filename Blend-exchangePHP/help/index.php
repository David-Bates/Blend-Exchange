            If you entered a password and still have it you can do that as soon as the feature is added.
            <h2>I clicked on the upload box nothing happend!</h2>
            That is a known issue... I'm working to fix it
            <h2>I clicked upload and it said invalid question</h2>
            You need to copy and paste the URL from the question into the text area. Be sure to get the full url with the http and everything. We do this to make it easier to check for abuse.
            <h2>The embed is not displaying properly</h2>
            Copy this strait into your post, don't try to wrap a link, image or any other markup. If it doesn't display properly in the preview, try backspacing then retyping a character, to get stack exchange to update the preview.
