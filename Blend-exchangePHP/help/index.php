            <h2>How do I edit or delete my .blend?</h2>
            If you entered a password when uploading, you can use it to do this. However this feature has not been implemented yet.
            <h2>I clicked on the upload box nothing happend!</h2>
            That is a known issue... I'm working to fix it
            <h2>I clicked upload and it said invalid question</h2>
            You need to copy and paste the URL from the question into the text area. Be sure to get the full url with the http and everything. We do this to make it easier to check for abuse.
            <h2>The embed is not displaying properly</h2>
            Copy the code straight into your post, don't try to wrap it in a link, image or any other markup. If it doesn't display properly in the preview, try backspacing then retyping a character to get stack exchange to update the preview.
