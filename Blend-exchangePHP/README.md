# Blend-Exchange
This is a project to add long term *(sorta permanent)* blend hosting for blender.stackexchange.com until we can [convince the SE lords to add the feature](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1050/12).

### Basic idea

Users can upload a file into a repo here on github or any free file storage system that can be accessed publicly from the web and written to programatically. Am embeddable link is then provided that can be used in markdown on StackExchange.

A question link is **mandatory** in order to insure it is only used for BSE questions since space is valuable. Uploaded files can be favorited and also peer reviewed by means of flagging.


### TODO for the project

* **Admin tools:**
 - [x] Login
 - [x] View flags basic
 - [ ] View flags advanced
 - [ ] View large files
 - [~] View suspecious ref files
 
* **Themes:**
 - <strike>[ ] CSS work *(ongoing)*</strike>
 - <strike>[ ] Switch themes via javascript</strike>
 - <strike>[ ] Switch themes via php</strike>
 
 *Currently, development on themes has been canceled*.
